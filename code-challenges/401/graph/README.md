# Graph
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Implementation of graph

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
implement a graph with the functionality to addNode, addEdge, getNodes, getNeighbors, and size

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I paid attention to the inclass demo, did some google research, a little planning and got to work, the Big O best case is O(1) for add but grows to O(n2) for get nodes

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
Vertex - Vertex class to construct new vertices
Edge - constructs a edge to connect vertices
Graph - constructs a new graph has addNode, addVertex, addEdge, addBiDirectionalEdge, getNodes, getNeighbors, pathTo, and size functions available
