## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
implement a function that iterates through two hash tables and performs a left join operation which means any keys that match table 1 from table 2, their values are added to a result array.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I paid attention to the inclass demo, did some google research, a little planning and got to work, the Big O is likely O(n2) due to multiple loops
