# Tree Intersection
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
create a function that takes two trees and searches for same values in each

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
create a function that will take in to two binary trees then search through each tree and compare the values, returning an array with any values that match

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I paid attention to the inclass demo, did some google research, a little planning and got to work on the whiteboard then translated the whiteboard to code, the Big O time for this implementation is O(n2) because it utilizes multiple loops.

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your trees -->
`treeIntersection` - takes two binary trees as parameters and returns an array with any matching values
