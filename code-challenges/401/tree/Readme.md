# Trees
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
create a binary tree class and a binary tree search class
added breadFirst function to binary tree
added findMaximumValue function to binary tree

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
create methods in the binary tree class called preOrder, postOrder and inOrder
create methods in the binary search tree class called add and contains
create method breadFirst search in binary tree
create method findMaximumValue in binary tree that finds the max value

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I paid attention to the inclass demo, did some google research, a little planning and got to work 

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your trees -->
preOrder - recursive function
postOrder - recursive function
inOrder - recursive function

breadthFirst - breadth first traversal

findMaximumValue - recursive find max value function

add - binary search tree add node
contains - binary search tree contains value
