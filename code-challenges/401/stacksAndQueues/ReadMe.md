# Stacks and Queues
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
build a stack and queue using a linked list format rather than array for storage

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
approaching building a stack and queue using a linked list rather than the "easy" route of an array for storage

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I thought about how to do this using a linked list, reviewed some of my linked list work, read the instructions several times, got to work.  The big O should mostly be O(1) although i did use a while loop in the enqueue method so that will be O(n) if used
